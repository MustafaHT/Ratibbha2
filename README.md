======================  List of technologies used  =======================>>


- Android Studio
- Figma
- Github
- Kotlin

=======================  User Stroies  =======================>>

- As Ratibbha user I want to add task so that I can see the upcoming tasks
- As Ratibbha user I want to be able to delete tasks if there are no longer needed so that user knows his tasks
- As Ratibbha user I want to be able to edite tasks so that the user can update his tasks
- As Ratibbha user I want to be able to have my cards in different colors based on the importance so that the user knows his importance
- As Ratibbha user I want to to be able to see sign of completion so that the user know the tasks he/she finished
- As Ratibbha user I want to be able to see a writing that tells me when the time is off so that the user knows his/her deadline timee.
- As Ratibbha user I want TO be able to have login and password to protect my information so that I can have privacy

====================== my development process ========================>>

In the beginning, I've started to think of how the app going to look like. For that reason, I began with sketching up my design by adding and removing features.
Next, I've decided to make a brainstorm for getting new ideas from other people on social media, which was really helpful to me and opened my mind to new other ideas more
than the requirements needed.

Then, as I finished sketching, I started my work with Figma till I got the last and simplest design. After that, started designing with Android studio where it was a much way harder than Figma, so I've spent more than three nights working on the ideas and design, where the rest of the five nights has been spent in coding. Which I consider it as the biggest mistake during the project process. Because, whether it was a good look or not the user will not care about the design if the app satisfies his needs. 

Later on, during the coding process, I've faced a lot of difficulties such as adding the Calendar and Time dialogue so it can appears with at the same button, so it can ask the user to enter the day that he wants to start his task on, including the startTime and endTime which I used google to help deal with. In addition, dealing with logical errors either by gitting hints from my colleagues or help from the instructors.  

======================  List unsolved problems   ========================>>

one of the problems that faced was that the length of the topic as I wanted to manage the length of the topic the user can enter. Another one was when some registers a new account, I want to avoid user information conflict so that the information of the user stays safe. One more unsolved problem was that the app was working perfectly for the due date. However, when testing it late, I found an issue with that I could not solve which shows the importance of early testing of the app.
