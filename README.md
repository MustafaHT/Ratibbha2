====================== my development process ========================>>

In the beginning, I've started to think of how the app will going to look like. For that reason, I began with sketching up my design by adding and removing features.
Next, I've decided to make a brainstorm for getting new ideas from other people on social media, which was really helpful to me and opened my mind to new other ideas more
than the requirements that were needed.

Then, as I finished sketching, I started my work with Figma till I got the last and simplest shape. After that, started designing with Android studio where it was a motch way harder than Figma, so I've spent more than three nights working on the ideas and design, where the rest of the 5 nights has been spent in coding. Which I consider it as my biggest mistake during the project process. Because, whether it was a good look or not the user will not care about the design if the app satisfies his needs.
